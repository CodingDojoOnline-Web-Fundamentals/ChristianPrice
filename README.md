Initial Pacman code. Still need to complete the following: 
1) Get Pacman to lookup up/down/left/right depending on the direction Pacman is moving.
2) Get a ghost to show up (the ghost does not have to move yet). When Pacman meets the ghost, have Pacman lose its life.
3) Get the ghost to move around in random directions.
4) Get two Pacmans to show up and move! (use one keyboard to move 2 Pacmans)
